# GlobalTouch - JPM GUTS Submission

## Setup

1. Install mysql with `pip install mysql-connector-python`
2. Install tkinter with `pip install tk`
3. Install requests with `pip install requests`

Run GUI.py to start using the program

# Server / Security Notes

Since this was just a prototype, it's really not secure at all. Logins are verified entirely client side, and the server was just running an SQL database that was connected to directly (with full permissions and keys given to every client). SSL certs, API keys and the server IP have been removed for this release.
